							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> ypography is an essential part of designing a website to help enhance the other 
								attributes of the design and create an aesthetic appeal to users. Fonts have the 
								power to establish visual hierarchy, which improves readability and creates 
								emphasis on certain focal points. From the font style, size, placement, and purpose,
								typography brings an important feature to the design. Overall, it is crucial that 
								every aspect of the design has meaning and adds to the experience of the user.  </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning how to make my own typography
								styleguide. It sets up the relationships between the types of fronts that will be used
								throughout the design. Are they compatiable with each other? And the color, does the color
								match the overdesign? How does the color look with that specfic font? Colors must 
								harmonize with each other and within the color palette. </p>
