							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that animation speed depends on the size of the device and the function of the device. On a smaller screen, 
								the duration of an animation should be shorter because there is less distance whereas a larger screen should have a longer
								animation duration because there is a larger screen. This is because the animation cannot be too slow or too fast in order to
								appeal to the user. Longer duration on a small screen would be too slow, and a fast duration on a large screen would be too 
								fast. However, on the web, usually we expect faster response times, so the animation duration would be shorter despite the large
								screen. It's because we expect the web to be fast as it is connected to the internet and should yield instant reponses, so having
								an animation with a longer duration would not be effective because the user might think that the computer is slow to load
								or the internet is not working. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was learning about how specific movements are important to how animation is presented to the user. 
								One example is clicking on a box and expanding it to the size of the screen. The good example 
								was the smaller box moving with a curve/arc when it grows larger versus moving in a linear fashion when it grows larger. 
								It's a subtle feature and I didn't even think about it until the animation was slowed down. But that movement is good for 
								rectangles, and a linear motion would be better for square. We might not be thinking of 
								features that small, but they add to the fluidity of how the user interacts and experiences in the design. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> " Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand 
								what to expect from the interface." </p>
