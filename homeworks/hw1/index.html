            Hi! My name is Cassandra, but I go by Cassie. The other person in this picture is my brother, he's four years younger than me.
            I was born and raised in Southern California. Here in NoCal, I enjoy exploring the Bay Area by eating lots of food and 
            visiting different cities. I love listening to music, mostly 5 Seconds of Summer, but I don't have a 
            preference....except rap, and some country. I also enjoy playing/watching soccer, reading books, building Legos, and relaxing on the Glade.

                I learned to break down the different components of an app. There are four idea needed to analyze what makes the app appealing to users: 
                Hierarchy, Content, Intent and Audience. These ideas help shape the way users interact with the app. After breaking down Twitter and Spotify, 
                there are things that I realized about the formats the apps use and the way that it is designed to appeal to users.

                My favorite part of the article is that everyday things can help you become better at design. Just simply opening up an app that you use 
                on a daily basis can help you study the way it was designed and formatted to be successful. I liked how the article analyzed two popular 
                apps and deconstructed them, showing how exactly these apps are aethetically appealing to users.

                "By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."
