							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessiblity is crucial for choosing the right color palettes for the website design as well as making 
								sure that visual indicators are not solely reliant on color. For example, turning a box green or red isn't the best 
								way to show that it is correct or incorrect, add utilize symbols/icons to help those who have visual impairments. 
								Additionally, adding contrast increases color accessiblity because it makes it readable. Colors similar to one another
								and are close in promixity decreases the readability because the colors blend together, versus contrasting colors make 
								them distinct and seperate.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was addressing the need for color accessibilty. I didn't think about it before and completely overlooked 
								the fact that there are people with visual impairments that use the internet. Learning about color accessibility, especially 
								the use of symbols and icons to help add to the function of color that everyone can see. I also liked that there are laws regarding
								this, which I didn't knw about so it was nice to learn that about this accessibility.
