							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Design and psychology are linked to one another and can be understood 
								through the Gestalt principles. The principles are built on the idea of 
							 	emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance. These four 
								principles show how the brain fills in gaps and to help us understand
								things that we see. Emergence is the recognition of elements through outlines,
								reification is the matching of familiar patterns with elements that have missing
								parts, multi-stability is the interpretation of ambiguous elements, and 
								invarience is recognizing simple objects independent of their composition. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was learning about the four ideas that shape 
								the Gestalt principles. I always found the way we think and perceive things 
								interesting and I thought learning about that in relation to deign and how 
								it plays a large part in the way we interpret designs was fascinating. Additionally, 
								learning about some of the Gestalt principles being used in UI design really 
								helped me see designing in a different way, and I got to expand my knowledge of
								what makes a design good.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing 
								previous experiences or visual patterns and connecting the dots." </p>
