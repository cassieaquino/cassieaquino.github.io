					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src = "assets/imgs/uswnt_website.jpg"/> </p>
							<p> Website Used: USWNT Upcoming Schedule </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img src = "assets/imgs/uswnt_redesign.jpg"/> </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> This particular page provides the schedule of the Women's National Soccer Team with the date, location, time, the opponents, type of match, tournament (if applicable), 
								and streaming services. It provides all the information up front for fans to know when the upcoming matches are by formatting them in both a list and 
								card view. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> My redesign condenses more of the information, making it more readable by providing the very basic information such as the date, time and opponent. With this new 
								design, it is easier to read without having too much information provided all at once. It would be a click to expand so that more information can be provided, but 
								all the important information for fans who are looking to watch/attend is already given at first glance.  </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
