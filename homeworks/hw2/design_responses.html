							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> White space plays a huge role in guiding user experience by organizing the different components on the page and creating focal points. 
								It redirects the user's attention by creating emphasis on particular components and a balance throughout the website. This brings all the 
								important information to the forefront, forcing the user to pay attention to it. It also differeniates the different components, creating an 
								organized structure instead of it being all cluttered, which also emphasizes the focal points.     </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is the address to the "white space is wasted space" myth. When I was in high school, there was always an 
								emphasis on utilizing all the space given and to not waste anything. That was definitely my thought before reading the article 
								but I learned how important white space is. And I liked the idea that "less is more" because in design, it is a "show, not tell" which 
								is really powerful in appealing to the users. </p>
