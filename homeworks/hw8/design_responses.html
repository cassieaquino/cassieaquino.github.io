					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The different types of dark patterns that are used commonly today. For example, disguised ads, forced continuity, hidden costs, 
							misdirection and trick questions are all practices of dark patterns not only limited to online. The biggest one is being used 
							against democracy by helping fake news spread, pushed forward with personalized algorithms that feed users both true and false 
							information. This kind of misleading contributes to unethical technology, giving a rise for technology that is used for social good, 
							not ones that are weaponized to create polorization in society.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Leaning about different types of dark patterns to help identify some if we ever come across them. It is important to be aware of 
							things that can hurt us in the future and being able to identify and do something about it prevents us from ever being in that position. 
							Another thing is the call to people in tech to be more concious about their decisions when designing their product. They have to be 
							ethically aware about their decisions affect others and the power they have to control society. It's also dangerous because it shows us 
							how one entity could essentially control the direction of society by leading people down different paths. That's my favorite part because 
							one thing I want to do is help direct tech for social good and it's important that these issues are being brought up so others are aware. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Dark patterns, on the other hand, are not mistakes. They're carefully crafted 
							with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user's interest in mind." </p>
