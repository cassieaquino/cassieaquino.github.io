                            <p> Designs utilize a lot of animated features to help guide the flow of the user interactions. It makes transitions between 
                                different aspects add more character and flowing transitions to the design rather than causing abrupt changes. For example, in "Selected Works
                                Transitions Experiements" by Zhenya Rynzhuk, the use of animated features helps create the transitions between viewing the different pictures 
                                interesting while eliminating any hardcuts that ruin the flow of the design. These features also just add to the characteristic of the design to emphasize 
                                the design's/product's purpose. For example, "Prism" by Ruslan Siiz utilizes a scrolling feature where additional items pop up as the user continues 
                                to scroll, and even includes moving backgrounds to really highlight what they do. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked that we were given designs to look at and interpret and enjoy it for ourselves rather than having someone else explain it to us. Without any explanations, 
                                we can experience the designs with our own thoughts and perspectives instead of being influenced by someone who wrote an article and is explaining the different 
                                components of the design. It makes it more powerful to let the design to the talking than reading a paragraph about it, and that's the whole idea of designing is 
                                to show and not tell, which this article does. The article lets the design speak for itself and connect with us and not a paragraph that is feeding us information.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> One inspiration that caught my eye was the "easygrow.io app preview" by Edmond Vasar. It's such a simple design, but it really focuses on the ideas that it prsents. 
                                I especially liked the different pages of the vegetables with the pictures, and a 3 dimension feel with the different depths of each component. The transition between 
                                each vegetable was smooth and appealing, creating a continuation between each one instead of abrupt cuts. It's a very simple design, giving the necessary information 
                                right off the bat, which makes it not overwhelming and then expanding for more information based on what the user is looking for.  </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
